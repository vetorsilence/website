For a while now, Oliver's been on the hunt for the biggest book. He's always been a fan of physically huge books &mdash; last year, at age 8, he spent $50.00 of his own hard-earned allowance on a massive (and quite beautiful) history of architecture that requires its own table &mdash; but lately, he's been keen to determine the book with the highest page count.

Oliver, meet the OED: 21,000 pages and counting.
