For his birthday this year, my son got a couple of [Snap Circuits](https://www.elenco.com/brand/snap-circuits/) sets. If you don't know about these, they're pretty awesome: you pop a couple of AA batteries into a little plastic power supply, snap that onto the grid of a clear plastic [breadboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadboard), and learn about electronics by stepping through a workbook with dozens of projects, connecting chunky plastic switches, resistors, LEDs and soundmakers. Stuff makes noise, lights up, flies into the air &mdash; it's neat, and he loves it. We worked through a bunch of them this past Christmas morning, and within a few days he'd finished the book on his own. The new sets, from us and his grandparents, finally arrived last week. Batteries not included.

The kids used to say, "Mama's in charge of Target. Papa's in charge of batteries." This is still how they understand the order of things, so when the power's gone out on something, they naturally come looking for me. Double-As, triple-As, nine-volts (yes, they're still out there), lantern batteries, flashlight batteries, watch batteries, digital-camera camera batteries, iPod batteries, batteries that go into [those LED candles you get from Ikea](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50355574/) &mdash; I'm sure I'm forgetting a half-dozen others &ndash; they all come running to me for them, for I am the Battery Charger.

Several years back, out of [concern for the environment](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/06/how-do-batteries-affect-the-environment/) and also my pocketbook, I switched to [rechargeables](https://www.panasonic.com/global/consumer/battery/eneloop.html) and been happy ever since, because my need for yet more batteries only seems to increase. When the new [Rover](https://www.elenco.com/product/snap-rover/) arrived, I had a free 9V in a bin in the garage, but I was all out of AAs, so I procure at least six more.

Like everyone else, I used to just grab them on Amazon. But this year, my wife decided we'd become too reliant on Amazon: we were going to cancel our Prime membership start doing more shopping locally. This was fine with me &mdash; I got to keep all of my servers running happily on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) &mdash; but when you choose not to renew your Prime membership, you definitely feel it: I could no longer thumb a couple of battery packs into my cart; now, I had to get into the car and go looking for things. Which takes time. And patience. Because nobody seems to carry anything anymore.

We tried Target, Best Buy, Costco, even [Batteries + Bulbs](https://www.batteriesplus.com/) &mdash; nobody carried the Eneloops, only Energizers, which were pricier (and you had to buy a charger, too). My wife remembered the Amazon Bookstore at UVillage had batteries, so as a last resort, we decided to just buy them there. We stopped in today. (My son's been waiting almost a week at this point.)

"No rechargables," the salesperson said. "Just alkalines." You could buy a brick of Amazon-branded AA alkalines for like seventeen cents, but I wasn't having it. "I don't want those," I said. So we left.

apple keyboard, mouse. phones. basically i have to keep a mental tally of all the things around me that require power, and this is exhausting.
