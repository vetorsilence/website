It was already late in the afternoon by the time we left, and it was a half-hour drive to get there, and cold (like mid-thirties-cold), and rainy &mdash; but in order to keep from breaking our hike-a-week streak, we chose to head out anyway, to Lord Hill Park.

We managed to get about a mile or so into the main loop &mdash; lots of mud, rain, but still, pretty &mdash; before the hail started to come down. Which was fine, by itself &mdash; but when it started to pile up, and the trail we'd planned to take back had been closed off with caution tape, I admit, I got a bit nervous.

By the time we got back, we were all pretty beat. Rosie cried. I had to carry her. And the drive back was icy.and I should come back to this one, because there's a story to tell, here.
