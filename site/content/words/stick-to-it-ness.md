Several years back, I was standing in line at Magic Mountain, under the sweltering California sun, for what I believe but cannot confirm was a Superman ride. I've never been much of an amusement-park person; it's usually hot, so you sweat a lot, it's crowded, the food is expensive and terrible, and too often you leave exhausted and disppointed. On this particular day, I was with my girlfriend at the time and a group of mutual friends, maybe a year or two out of college, struggling to figure out what to do with my life. I had a degree in English and had done a little writing for the _[OC Weekly](https://www.ocweekly.com/), coming up against the the hard realities of making a living on your words, and while I had dreams of writing stories or novels or screenplays, I hadn't done any such thing yet, and I was beginning to consider getting into programming. Apropos of nothing, my friend decided to speak up about this.

"Your boyfriend doesn't have the stick-to-it-ness to become a writer," he said.
