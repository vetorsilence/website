At [Chef](https://chef.io), we have an excellent [vacation policy](https://www.glassdoor.com/Benefits/Chef-Software-US-Benefits-EI_IE444809.0,13_IL.14,16_IN1.htm): _unlimited, paid time off_ &mdash; and you're actually encouraged to take it. I've never been great at doing that, though; a few years back, I did take a month for a cross-country road trip with the family, and I've taken the occasional two weeks here and there, but I don't take nearly as many one-off day-cations as some of my fellow Chefs do.

So this month, I decided to change that, and I thought it might be fun to absolve myself of some of the responsibility for doing so by writing a little program to choose the days randomly for me: two days per month to select from, one from the first half and one from the second &mdash; excluding weekends and holidays, of course.

It was a fun little exercise. Here's the code &mdash; click <strong>Result</strong> for the outcome:

  data-user="cnunciato"

Now, these aren't _my_ days off &mdash; they're yours! (Should you choose to accept them.) And this algorithm isn't perfect, I know; I'm sure it leaves at least a couple of loose ends untied. But I'm okay with that, because it gets the job done: my first day off is this coming Friday, when I plan to take the kids either out for a sail or to check out the [Seattle Bouldering Project](https://seattleboulderingproject.com/), and to give my wife a much-needed break from the demands of homeschooling and kid-handling.
