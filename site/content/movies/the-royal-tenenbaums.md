By now you can probably see what we’re up to here, working our way up through Wes Anderson history. I saw Tenenbaums for the first time before its release, at an IFP West screening I believe it was, somewhere in LA, and I remember both standing in line for a long time (after a good, long drive up from Orange County, too) and that the Q&A afterward, which Anderson attended, was surprisingly and disappointingly short.

Back then, I found the overall artificiality of the movie — its presentation as a kind of coffee-table novel, the narration, the voluminous production design, etc. — aesthetically interesting, and certainly novel for the time, but on the whole distracting; it felt like there was a good story in there somewhere, in the corners of the dollhouse, obscured by all the makeup, costumes, and paint.

I wrote about the movie in grad school actually, and I remember my dissenting opinion being a decidedly unpopular one, but I stood by it, and I still do, today, despite having a much broader perspective than I had then, particularly in matters involving children and the ramifications of shitty parenting. Less, but better, I kept thinking; stop, with all the smoking and accessories — let me _see_ why things are the way they are. Don’t just _tell_ me Chas is a master of finance: that’s cheating, and ultimately, it doesn’t matter anyway. This movie is not about his brilliance, or his brother’s tennis career, or Margot’s plays (and incidentally, I have a hard time believing Margot could muster the energy to write _anything_, let along great strings of successful theater over periods of years); I t’s about what a terrible father they all had, and how their mother saved their lives. I couldn’t quite make that out when I saw it the first time, but I see it now, and if anything, I’m left wanting still more.

So for me, at least at this point, it’s still Bottle Rocket in the number-one spot. We’ll see how it plays out, though.
