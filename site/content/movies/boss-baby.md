So, let me get this straight.

The bad guy is a disgruntled former baby who runs a massive puppy company, for which the good guy's parents both work (in marketing, no less), and he (the bad guy) is intent on creating puppies so perfect that they drain humanity's capacity of so much love that it can no longer make babies? What kind of long term business model is that? IMPLAUSIBLE.
