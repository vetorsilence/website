This was Sammy's pick for his seventh birthday. Everyone knows this is a great movie &mdash; this is no great revelation &mdash; but what struck me on this most recent viewing, which must have been my hundredth by now, were the performances &mdash; they're incredible. The little moments, little looks, so many of them. Just wonderful.
