"Sure," I said. "I'd love go to a movie about death and dying and dead people and deadness. I don't have any personal anxiety about that subject at all! Let's do it."

So we took the kids to the [Crest](https://www.yelp.com/biz/crest-cinema-center-shoreline), a little '50s-era theater in Shoreline, to see [_Coco_](http://movies.disney.com/coco), the latest from Pixar. We love the crest because it's small, shows consistently good movies (a good portion of which are documentaries), and tickets are $4.00 across the board, so we can all go for just twenty bucks, and I can enjoy a nice, cold beer while you're there. (For posterity's sake, I went with the [Lagunitas IPA](https://lagunitas.com/beer/IPA) this time.)

I enjoyed this movie a lot, though. It opened with a brief clip from the director, Lee Unkrich (who co-directed _Monsters, Inc._, _Finding Nemo_, and two of the _Toy Story_ movies), thanking the audience for taking the time to come to the theater, which was neat. (Sitting there with my kids, I hoped we'd be able to keep seeing movies this way for as long as possible; we've still got plenty of theaters around, but at upwards of fifteen bucks a ticket for most of them, it becomes the kind of thing, with kids, that you start to think twice about, knowing that if you want a few weeks, you can rent it or buy it for the price of a single ticket.) In his book *Do the movies have a future?*,

Anyway as I sat there, I wondered how they'd manage to make a movie about death and loss, and peopled almost entirely with skeletons, appealing to kids &mdash; but they did. And it was a beautifully _made_ movie, too; it has to be the most richly colorful and textured Pixar movie ever &mdash; lots of deep blacks and rich purples and oranges, yellows, bright lights and incredible depth &mdash;
