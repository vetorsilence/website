A very strange movie, indeed, about the director's relationship with Rome over the years. In it, among many, _many_ other things, you will encounter:

* traffic,
* hippies,
* Anna Magnani,
* an extended, fascinating, sublimely _odd_ pageant of priests, nuns and other clergyfolk modeling the latest in ecclesiastial outerwear, sometimes on wheels (you just have to see it),
* Lots and lots of food and the consuming of it,
* prostitutes,
*
* The excavation of an underground tunnel,
* Gore Vidal
