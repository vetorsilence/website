You're only here for a blink in the history of the universe. You make a few marks on the wall of the cave and then youâ€™re gone. As an artist, all you can leave behind is some indication of what life meant to you, and what you have learned about it in that brief time. If the earth were destroyed tomorrow and all that was left was a few films, would *The Blair Witch Project*, *Showgirls*, and *Fatal Attraction* represent what it was to be human? Our films give us the same few animalistic emotions over and over again. Most of life has never made it into the movies.
