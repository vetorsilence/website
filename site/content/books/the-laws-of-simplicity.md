It's good. I mean it starts off strong, and I love the bits about reducing, and the quote at the end &mdash; "Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious, and adding the meaningful" &mdash; sums things up well (no pun intended), but it definitely falls apart in the second half. 

Still, a good, brisk read, and a strong bibliography at the end as well.
