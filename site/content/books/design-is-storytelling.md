On the whole, fine — I’m still not a believer in the whole idea of “storytelling” in design, but I do believe in the possibility of story as it relates to the individual journey. If story does exist in experience design, it happens in the mind of the person having the experience, if at all. I think at this point, I’m still siding a bit with Sagmeister: it still feels a bit like bullshit.
