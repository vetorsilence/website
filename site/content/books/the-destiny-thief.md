Among the many insights packed into this book — which I’ll surely have to buy, note to self — was one about the usefulness of the third person omniscient voice, which is one I’ve actually never even tried, and largely for the reasons he mentions.

I love this guy, Russo. How do I have none of his short stories in my library?
