Toward the end of our first on day Kauai, we managed to find [The Fresh Shave](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-fresh-shave-kalaheo-8), a little trailer parked in a patch of gravel alongside Highway 530 in [Kalaheo](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kalaheo,+HI+96741/@22.0426634,-159.5858023,12.05z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x7c070456fd3d5f5d:0xdb44269b0af6136!8m2!3d21.9286111!4d-159.5302778) that we'd read about in [_Lonely Planet Kauai_](https://shop.lonelyplanet.com/products/kauai-travel-guide-3). It's run by a family [from California](http://www.thegardenisland.com/2017/01/04/business/local-business-expanding-to-california/), so depending on what you're looking for, it might not quite bring the island-native vibe (tending a little to the Northwest-hipstery side, with the vintage trailer and sticker-mustaches), but hey &mdash; it's amazing stuff nonetheless: made with all local and organic fruits and ingredients, an excellent treat after a day at the beach.

At six bucks a pop, though, Rebecca and I chose to forgo ordering for ourselves, so as you listen to this, and gaze at these photos (or worse, scroll through [Fresh Shave on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thefreshshave/)), just imagine what it felt like for us, watching them dive into these with such glee, and feel our pain. Parenthood, man &mdash; it's all about the sacrifices.

And if you do make it to Kauai and go looking for shave ice, I should mention [Loco Coco](https://www.yelp.com/biz/loco-coco-shave-ice-koloa-2), too: it's also a little trailer in a parking lot, this one just outside [Kukuila Market](https://www.yelp.com/biz/kukuiula-market-koloa-2) (a lovely little family-run grocer in [Koloa](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Koloa,+HI+96756/@21.9022894,-159.483178,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x7c071b22d045fdc9:0x3452c3c675d8981c!8m2!3d21.9066667!4d-159.4691667) that kept us all well fed &mdash; and [well-beered](https://konabrewingco.com/our-beers/) &mdash; for the majority of our trip), and was easily as good, if not [_mo bettah_](http://bigislandvacation.com/Da_Kine_Pidgin.html).

And if you find yourself _there_ &mdash; or for that matter, even if you don't &mdash; you absolutely _must_ pick up a poke bowl from [Makai Sushi](https://www.yelp.com/biz/makai-sushi-koloa), which is probably the best food I've ever had in my entire life. But now I'm seriously digressing.

Anyway, on to the soothing sounds of childhood ice-treat consumption.
