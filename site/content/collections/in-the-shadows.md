    caption: Somewhere in Southern California on my way to have dinner with my sister.
      This was taken with one of a number of flip-phones I carried between 2005 and 2007 (way before Instagram) that I used
      to snap photos and send them to my website.

      remains my all-time favorite camera-that's-also-a-phone. I like the way the angle and the shoes in this one conspire to make me look a bit like a hipster munchkin.

      history and construction. (I can't seem to locate that particular film on YouTube, but there are several others worth watching if you're interested in this rather fascinating story, including [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHFiKKaCKl8), which is an hour long, and awesome.)

The conference was awesome (as it always is), and the second most awesome thing I remember about that week are the [Togo's sandwiches](http://www.togos.com/), which should give you some idea of how much there is to do, aside from attending software conferences, in Santa Clara.

In grad school, I did a research project for an independent-film course in which I surveyed the work of [Jim Jarmusch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jarmusch). In preparation for it, I watched all of his movies, and one thing I noticed was the repetition of certain visual patterns: in most, for instance, there existed a sequence in which the protagonist, along for a ride of some sort, would happen to glance offscreen to the right, we'd cut to her point of view, and then for a few moments, we'd watch through her eyes as ordinary buildings, houses (_Night on Earth_, others) or trees (_Dead Man_) went by, until finally returning to the character's expressionless reaction. It wasn't the kind of thing that necessarily _meant_ all that much, but all the same, patterns are patterns, and it's sometimes the ones that seem most trivial on the surface that lead to the most interesting conversations.

I'm not going to compare myself to Jim Jarmusch, of course. But given the number of pictures I've taken over the years, I figured there had to be at least some of this kind of repetition in my own work as well. So when my wife (with a bit of an eye roll) mentioned she'd noticed a few when assembling a photobook recently, I did a little scrolling through Lightroom. Turns out I do seem to take the same handful of pictures over and over &mdash; one of which is of my own (and sometimes other people's) shadows.

Whether there's any significance to that, I'll leave you to decide. What I can say is that I tend to snap these kinds of pictures when I'm happy, when the light's a bit unusual, and when the shadow happens to hop in front of me, catching me by surprise. There's probably also something to the way that shadows or silhouettes _suggest_, in their abstractness, rather than spell out: whereas photography is so often about capturing and representing reality with accuracy and completeness, the shadow sort of pushes in the opposite direction, asking the viewer to fill in the gaps, as it were, with a little imagination. And also, they're sometimes just funny.

You might also note the additional shadows that show up alongside me over the years, which tells a little story of its own.
