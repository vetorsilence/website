A little vertical-panoramic snapshot from a recent Sunday-morning outing &mdash; one of our favorite weekend walks, along the ship canal down in [Fremont](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fremont,+Seattle,+WA/@47.6570239,-122.3636676,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x549015ac65a569d5:0xa2c5a5c295534d98!8m2!3d47.6541773!4d-122.3500004).

Such a great city.
