I like this shot (which I took in 2016) mainly because it shows what you can't really do with an iPhone: you can't leave the shutter open for as long as you want. Here, with my [Canon 70D](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/cameras/dslr/eos-70d) and its excellent kit lens (at 18mm), I left the shutter open for 30 seconds at f8, ISO 100, in an effort to pull in as much color and light as I could. If you look closely, you can just make out the lights on a couple of planes on approach into SeaTAC, and a barely-silhouetted couple hanging out at the edge of the lake.

I've said it before, and I'll say it again: It's a good city.
