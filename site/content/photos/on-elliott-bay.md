Last year, I decided to learn to sail. I'd sailed a bit as a kid, but it'd been a long time (and I never really knew what I was doing then, anyway), so I figured it'd be good to learn for real, in order to start exploring the amazing waterways we have up here in the Puget Sound area.

So I signed up for the [ASA 101](https://asa.com/certifications/asa-101-basic-keelboat-sailing/) course at [Puget Sound Sailing Institute](http://www.pugetsoundsailing.com/), took it over a weekend (after studying for a good two weeks), passed (with a perfect score, woo!) and then joined the Open Boating program at [Sail Sand Point](http://www.sailsandpoint.org/) here on Lake Washington, where I spent the remainder of the summer and early fall practicing on [Lasers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_(dinghy)), [FJs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Junior) and [Hobie Waves](https://www.hobie.com/sail/wave/), the latter of which has become a favorite for Sunday afternoons with the wife and kiddos.

This year, it's more about getting out on the bigger keelboats for me; it's one thing to zip around on the lake in a dinghy, where the only real risk is the occasional capsize, but it's another thing entirely to navigate safely under sail around all the ferries and container ships moving about on [Elliott Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Bay). So every couple of weeks or so, I've been getting out on a great little [Catalina 22](https://www.catalinayachts.com/sport-series/22-sport/) with a few of my fellow Chefs &mdash; making mistakes, learning a ton, and gaining the confidence I'll need to get around here on my own someday, hopefully soon.

Here's a shot from a recent outing.
